# Deploy an astro website fast

This project automatically installs the necessary tools to your mac and deploys an astro website to cloudflare pages via github for you. This intention is to make starting an astro project as easy and quick as possibl, so you can get vibe coding asap!!

## How to use

Once you've cloned this project locally, set the `.sh` files to be executable by running

```sh
chmod +x setup.sh
```

```sh
chmod +x build-and-deploy.sh
```

You can then run setup.sh in the terminal simply by typing out `./setup.sh` in the terminal.
